# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This file explains the script file.
Run the run_analysis.R script in R studio.
This will download the file from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it.  Then it will process the output files.
The two files in the working directory to satisfy the project are:
meltData: a dataframe of  679,734 observations and 4 variables (Activity, Subject, Variable, Value)
sumTotal: a dataframe of 11,880 observations and 4 variables (Activity, Subject, Variable, Value)
